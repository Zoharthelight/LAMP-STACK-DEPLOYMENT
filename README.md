# LAMP Stack Deployment

This project showcases the deployment of a **LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)** on a Linux server.  
The stack provides a complete environment for hosting and running dynamic web applications.  
It includes configuring Apache as the web server, MySQL for database management, and PHP for server-side scripting.  
The deployment was tested with a sample `phpinfo()` page to verify integration of all components.

**Tech Stack:** Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP
